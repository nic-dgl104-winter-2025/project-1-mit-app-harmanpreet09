## How I Built It
Design: I created screens like the main menu, self-care tips, mental health topics, daily challenges, and emergency helplines using buttons, labels, and layouts.

Block Programming: I used blocks to create the logic for showing tips in modal boxes, generating challenges, and storing call history.

Challenges: Figuring out how to store multiple call logs without overwriting was tough, but I solved it by using TinyDB with lists.

## What’s Next?
I plan to add more tips, new challenges, and location-based helpline numbers to make the app even better.
